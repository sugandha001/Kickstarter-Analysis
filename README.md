# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise an up and coming Playwright wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever" in US.
Estimated Budget - $10,000

### Purpose
Determine if there are specific factors that make a campaign successful.

Help Louise mirror other successful Campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges
My analysis started with sorting the data in categories and then subcategories. Color marked outcomes based on campaign's success and failure. Filtered data based on country. Created pivot charts to see how launch dates affect outcomes. Used box plots to compare average budget Vs Louise estimated budget. Challenges were removing unwanted data. Overcame it by creating a box and whisker plot so we could address outliers.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May and June are good month to launch campaigns.

Launches during Beginning or the end of the year did not give good results.
